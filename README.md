# Intelligent Dust Sorting Machine  

An automated waste sorting system built with **Arduino**.


## Overview  
This system detects objects placed on a conveyor belt and automatically sorts them into three categories: **metal**, **wet**, or **dry**.  
It uses sensors, servo motors, an LCD display, and a buzzer to provide real-time feedback during the sorting process.  


## Features  
- Object detection with **IR sensor**  
- Metal detection with **proximity sensor**  
- Wet waste detection with **raindrop sensor**  
- Automated sorting using **servo motors**  
- Real-time stats on **LCD display** (counts & percentages)  
- Audio feedback with **buzzer**  


## Components

- **Microcontroller:** Arduino UNO  
- **Sensors:** IR Sensor, Proximity Sensor, Raindrop Sensor
- **Actuators:** Servo Motors
- **Feedback:** LCD Display, Buzzer, Push Button
- **Power Supply:** Portable Power Bank
- **Prototyping Tools:** Breadboard, Jumper Wires
